Problem statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/special-palindrome-again/problem?h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=strings

I have used springboot to develop RestApi interface for the above problem statement.

Run the application and hit the below api for response:
http://localhost:8080/get-special-string-count?str=abcbaba

The response format for the above api is as below:
{"count":10,"strings":["a","b","bcb","c","b","bab","a","aba","b","a"]}
